# UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)

## Overview
UMAP is a dimensionality reduction technique that is widely used for visualizing high-dimensional data. It is based on manifold learning and is particularly effective for preserving the global and local structure of data in lower dimensions.

## Key Concepts
- **Manifold Learning**: Assumes that high-dimensional data lies on a low-dimensional manifold.
- **Graph Representation**: Constructs a weighted graph of the data points to model their relationships.
- **Optimization**: Minimizes the difference between high-dimensional and low-dimensional representations.

## Algorithm
1. **Graph Construction**: Build a k-nearest neighbor graph to represent the data.
2. **Fuzzy Simplicial Set**: Compute a fuzzy topological representation of the data.
3. **Low-Dimensional Embedding**: Optimize the embedding to minimize the cross-entropy between the high-dimensional and low-dimensional representations.

## Advantages
- Preserves both local and global data structure.
- Computationally efficient for large datasets.
- Produces interpretable visualizations.

## Disadvantages
- Sensitive to hyperparameters like `n_neighbors` and `min_dist`.
- May not perform well on data with noise or outliers.
- Results can vary depending on initialization.

## Use Cases
- Visualizing high-dimensional datasets (e.g., gene expression, image embeddings).
- Preprocessing step for clustering or classification tasks.
- Analyzing relationships in large-scale datasets.
