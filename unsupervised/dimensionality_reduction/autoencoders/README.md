# Autoencoders

## Overview
Autoencoders are a type of artificial neural network used to learn efficient representations of data, typically for dimensionality reduction or feature extraction. They work by encoding input data into a compressed representation and then reconstructing the original data from this representation.

## Key Concepts
- **Encoder**: Maps the input data to a lower-dimensional latent space.
- **Latent Space**: The compressed representation of the input data.
- **Decoder**: Reconstructs the input data from the latent space representation.
- **Loss Function**: Measures the difference between the input and the reconstructed output, guiding the training process.

## Algorithm
1. Pass the input data through the encoder to obtain the latent representation.
2. Use the decoder to reconstruct the input data from the latent representation.
3. Compute the reconstruction loss (e.g., Mean Squared Error).
4. Update the model weights using backpropagation to minimize the loss.

## Advantages
- Reduces dimensionality while preserving important features.
- Can be used for unsupervised learning tasks.
- Effective for denoising and anomaly detection.

## Disadvantages
- May struggle with complex data distributions.
- Requires careful tuning of hyperparameters.
- Reconstruction quality depends on the size of the latent space.

## Use Cases
- Dimensionality reduction for visualization or preprocessing.
- Denoising images or signals.
- Anomaly detection in time-series data or images.
- Pretraining for deep learning models.
