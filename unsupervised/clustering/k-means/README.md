# K-Means Clustering

## Description
K-Means is an unsupervised learning algorithm used for clustering data into groups based on feature similarity. It minimizes the variance within clusters.

## Key Concepts
- **Centroids**: Central points representing each cluster.
- **Inertia**: Sum of squared distances between data points and their cluster centroids.
- **Iterations**: Repeatedly updating centroids until convergence.

## Common Applications
- Customer segmentation
- Image compression
- Market basket analysis
- Anomaly detection

## Advantages
- Simple and fast for small datasets.
- Works well with spherical clusters.
- Scales to large datasets.

## Disadvantages
- Requires specifying the number of clusters (K).
- Sensitive to initial centroid placement.
- Struggles with non-spherical clusters and outliers.
