# Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)

## Overview
Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) are probabilistic models used to represent normally distributed subpopulations within an overall population. They are commonly used for clustering and density estimation tasks in unsupervised learning.

## Key Concepts
- **Gaussian Distribution**: A bell-shaped curve representing the normal distribution of data.
- **Mixture Model**: A probabilistic model that assumes data is generated from a mixture of several distributions.
- **Expectation-Maximization (EM)**: An iterative algorithm used to estimate the parameters of the GMM.

## Algorithm
1. **Initialization**: Randomly initialize the parameters of the Gaussian components (mean, covariance, and mixing coefficients).
2. **Expectation Step (E-step)**: Calculate the probability of each data point belonging to each Gaussian component.
3. **Maximization Step (M-step)**: Update the parameters of the Gaussian components to maximize the likelihood of the data.
4. **Convergence**: Repeat the E-step and M-step until the parameters converge or a stopping criterion is met.

## Advantages
- Can model complex data distributions.
- Soft clustering allows data points to belong to multiple clusters with probabilities.
- Handles overlapping clusters effectively.

## Disadvantages
- Sensitive to initialization and may converge to local optima.
- Requires specifying the number of components beforehand.
- Computationally expensive for large datasets.

## Use Cases
- Image segmentation.
- Anomaly detection.
- Customer segmentation in marketing.
- Speech recognition and natural language processing.
