# Mean Shift Clustering

## Overview
Mean Shift is a clustering algorithm that does not require prior knowledge of the number of clusters. It works by iteratively shifting data points towards the mode (highest density) of the data distribution.

## Key Concepts
- **Kernel Density Estimation (KDE):** Used to estimate the data distribution.
- **Bandwidth:** A parameter that determines the radius of influence for each data point.
- **Convergence:** Points are shifted iteratively until they converge to the nearest mode.

## Algorithm
1. Initialize each data point as a cluster center.
2. For each point, compute the mean of all points within the bandwidth.
3. Shift the point to the computed mean.
4. Repeat until convergence.
5. Merge points that converge to the same mode into a single cluster.

## Advantages
- Does not require specifying the number of clusters.
- Can identify arbitrarily shaped clusters.
- Robust to outliers.

## Disadvantages
- Computationally expensive for large datasets.
- Sensitive to the choice of bandwidth.
- May struggle with high-dimensional data.

## Use Cases
- Image segmentation.
- Object tracking.
- Anomaly detection.
- Density estimation in spatial data.
