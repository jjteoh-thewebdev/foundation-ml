# Neural Network

## Overview
Neural networks are a subset of machine learning algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They consist of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process data and learn patterns to make predictions or decisions.

## Key Concepts
- **Neuron**: The basic unit of computation in a neural network.
- **Layers**: Input, hidden, and output layers that process data.
- **Weights and Biases**: Parameters adjusted during training to minimize error.
- **Activation Function**: Determines the output of a neuron.
- **Backpropagation**: Algorithm for updating weights using gradient descent.

## Algorithm
1. Initialize weights and biases.
2. Forward propagate input data through the network.
3. Compute the loss using a loss function.
4. Backpropagate the error to update weights and biases.
5. Repeat until the model converges or reaches a stopping criterion.

## Advantages
- Can model complex, non-linear relationships.
- Highly scalable for large datasets.
- Effective for tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and more.

## Disadvantages
- Requires significant computational resources.
- Prone to overfitting without proper regularization.
- Often considered a "black box" due to lack of interpretability.

## Use Cases
- Image and speech recognition.
- Natural language processing.
- Autonomous vehicles.
- Fraud detection.
- Recommendation systems.
