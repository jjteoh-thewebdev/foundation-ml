# Random Forest Regressor

## Overview
The Random Forest Regressor is an ensemble learning method used for regression tasks. It operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputting the mean prediction of the individual trees. This approach reduces overfitting and improves predictive accuracy.

## Key Concepts
- **Ensemble Learning**: Combines predictions from multiple models to improve performance.
- **Decision Trees**: Base learners used in the random forest algorithm.
- **Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)**: Random sampling with replacement to create diverse subsets of data for training each tree.
- **Feature Randomness**: Random selection of features for splitting nodes in each tree.

## Algorithm
1. Draw multiple bootstrap samples from the training dataset.
2. Train a decision tree on each bootstrap sample, using a random subset of features at each split.
3. Aggregate the predictions of all trees by averaging their outputs for regression tasks.

## Advantages
- Handles large datasets efficiently.
- Reduces overfitting compared to individual decision trees.
- Works well with both numerical and categorical data.
- Robust to noise and outliers.

## Disadvantages
- Can be computationally expensive for large datasets.
- Less interpretable compared to a single decision tree.
- May require hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.

## Use Cases
- Predicting house prices based on various features.
- Forecasting sales or demand in retail.
- Modeling environmental data, such as temperature or rainfall predictions.
- Financial risk assessment and stock price prediction.
