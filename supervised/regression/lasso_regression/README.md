# Lasso Regression

## Overview
Lasso Regression, or Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, is a type of linear regression that performs both variable selection and regularization to enhance the prediction accuracy and interpretability of the statistical model it produces.

## Key Concepts
- **Regularization**: Adds a penalty term to the loss function to prevent overfitting.
- **L1 Penalty**: The penalty term in Lasso is the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients, which can shrink some coefficients to exactly zero.
- **Feature Selection**: By shrinking coefficients to zero, Lasso effectively selects a subset of features.

## Algorithm
1. Start with a dataset containing features and target variables.
2. Define the Lasso regression objective function:
    \[
    \text{Minimize: } \frac{1}{2n} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^p |\beta_j|
    \]
    where \( \lambda \) controls the strength of regularization.
3. Solve the optimization problem to find the coefficients \( \beta \).
4. Use the resulting model for predictions.

## Advantages
- Performs feature selection by shrinking irrelevant feature coefficients to zero.
- Reduces model complexity and prevents overfitting.
- Works well when there are many correlated features.

## Disadvantages
- May not perform well when the number of features exceeds the number of observations.
- Can struggle with highly collinear data, as it arbitrarily selects one feature from a group of correlated features.

## Use Cases
- Predictive modeling in high-dimensional datasets.
- Feature selection in machine learning pipelines.
- Applications in finance, healthcare, and marketing where interpretability is important.
