# Gradient Boosting Regressor

## Overview
Gradient Boosting Regressor is a machine learning algorithm used for regression tasks. It builds an ensemble of weak learners, typically decision trees, and combines them to create a strong predictive model. The algorithm minimizes the loss function by iteratively adding models that correct the errors of the previous ones.

## Key Concepts
- **Boosting**: A technique that combines multiple weak learners to form a strong learner.
- **Gradient Descent**: Optimization method used to minimize the loss function by adjusting model parameters.
- **Loss Function**: Measures the difference between predicted and actual values (e.g., Mean Squared Error for regression tasks).
- **Weak Learners**: Simple models, such as decision trees, that perform slightly better than random guessing.

## Algorithm
1. Initialize the model with a constant prediction (e.g., the mean of the target values).
2. Compute the residuals (errors) between the predicted and actual values.
3. Fit a weak learner (e.g., decision tree) to the residuals.
4. Update the model by adding the predictions of the weak learner, scaled by a learning rate.
5. Repeat steps 2â€“4 for a predefined number of iterations or until convergence.

## Advantages
- Handles both linear and non-linear relationships.
- Robust to overfitting with proper regularization (e.g., learning rate, tree depth).
- Can handle missing data and does not require feature scaling.

## Disadvantages
- Computationally expensive, especially with large datasets.
- Sensitive to hyperparameter tuning (e.g., learning rate, number of estimators).
- Prone to overfitting if the number of iterations is too high.

## Use Cases
- Predicting house prices based on features like location, size, and amenities.
- Forecasting sales or demand in retail and e-commerce.
- Modeling financial risk or credit scoring.
- Analyzing medical data for predicting patient outcomes.
