# Ridge Regression

## Overview
Ridge Regression is a type of linear regression that includes a regularization term to prevent overfitting. It is particularly useful when dealing with multicollinearity or when the number of predictors exceeds the number of observations.

## Key Concepts
- **Regularization**: Ridge Regression adds an L2 penalty to the loss function, which shrinks the coefficients towards zero.
- **Bias-Variance Tradeoff**: By introducing regularization, Ridge Regression reduces variance at the cost of a small increase in bias.
- **Hyperparameter (λ)**: The regularization strength is controlled by a hyperparameter, often denoted as λ or alpha.

## Algorithm
1. Start with the standard linear regression model: \( y = X\beta + \epsilon \).
2. Add the L2 penalty to the loss function:  
    \( \text{Loss} = ||y - X\beta||^2 + \lambda||\beta||^2 \).
3. Solve for the coefficients \( \beta \) that minimize the penalized loss function.

## Advantages
- Reduces overfitting by penalizing large coefficients.
- Handles multicollinearity effectively.
- Works well with high-dimensional data.

## Disadvantages
- May introduce bias into the model.
- Requires careful tuning of the regularization parameter.
- Does not perform feature selection (unlike Lasso Regression).

## Use Cases
- Predictive modeling in datasets with multicollinearity.
- High-dimensional datasets where the number of features exceeds the number of samples.
- Applications in finance, healthcare, and marketing where interpretability and reduced overfitting are important.
