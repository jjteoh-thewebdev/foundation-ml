# Support Vector Regression (SVR)

## Overview
Support Vector Regression (SVR) is a supervised learning algorithm that applies the principles of Support Vector Machines (SVM) to regression problems. It aims to find a function that approximates the relationship between input features and continuous target values while maintaining a margin of tolerance for error.

## Key Concepts
- **Support Vectors**: Data points that define the margin and influence the regression model.
- **Kernel Functions**: Functions that transform input data into higher-dimensional spaces to handle non-linear relationships. Common kernels include linear, polynomial, and radial basis function (RBF).
- **Epsilon Margin**: A tolerance level within which predictions are considered acceptable without penalty.
- **Regularization Parameter (C)**: Controls the trade-off between achieving a low error on the training data and maintaining a smooth model.

## Algorithm
1. Map the input data into a higher-dimensional space using a kernel function.
2. Define a margin of tolerance (epsilon) around the true values.
3. Solve an optimization problem to minimize the error while keeping the model complexity low.
4. Use support vectors to construct the regression function.

## Advantages
- Handles both linear and non-linear relationships effectively.
- Robust to outliers due to the use of the epsilon margin.
- Can work well with high-dimensional data.

## Disadvantages
- Computationally intensive for large datasets.
- Requires careful tuning of hyperparameters (e.g., kernel, C, epsilon).
- Sensitive to the choice of kernel function.

## Use Cases
- Predicting housing prices based on features like location, size, and amenities.
- Forecasting stock prices or financial trends.
- Modeling complex relationships in scientific experiments or engineering applications.
