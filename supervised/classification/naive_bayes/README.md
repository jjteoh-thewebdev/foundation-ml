# Naive Bayes

## Description
Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem. It assumes independence between features, making it simple and efficient.

## Key Concepts
- **Bayes' Theorem**: Calculates probabilities based on prior knowledge.
- **Conditional Independence**: Assumes features are independent given the target.
- **Likelihood**: The probability of data given a class.

## Common Applications
- Text classification (e.g., spam detection)
- Sentiment analysis
- Document categorization
- Medical diagnosis

## Advantages
- Fast and efficient for large datasets.
- Performs well with high-dimensional data.
- Easy to implement and interpret.

## Disadvantages
- Assumes feature independence, which may not hold in practice.
- Struggles with continuous data unless discretized.
- Sensitive to imbalanced datasets.
