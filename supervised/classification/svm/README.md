# Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Description
Support Vector Machine is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression. It finds the hyperplane that best separates data into classes.

## Key Concepts
- **Hyperplane**: A decision boundary that separates classes.
- **Support Vectors**: Data points closest to the hyperplane, influencing its position.
- **Kernel Trick**: Transforms data into higher dimensions for better separation.

## Common Applications
- Text classification
- Image recognition
- Bioinformatics (e.g., protein classification)
- Face detection

## Advantages
- Effective in high-dimensional spaces.
- Works well with clear margin of separation.
- Versatile with different kernel functions.

## Disadvantages
- Computationally expensive for large datasets.
- Sensitive to the choice of kernel and parameters.
- Struggles with overlapping classes.
