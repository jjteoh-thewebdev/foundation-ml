# XGBoost

## Overview

XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is an optimized distributed gradient boosting library designed to be highly efficient, flexible and portable. It implements machine learning algorithms under the Gradient Boosting framework. XGBoost provides a parallel tree boosting (also known as GBDT, GBM) that solves many data science problems in a fast and accurate way.

## Key Concepts

*   **Gradient Boosting:** XGBoost is an implementation of gradient boosting algorithm.
*   **Regularization:** Includes L1 and L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.
*   **Parallel Processing:** Supports parallel processing for faster training.
*   **Tree Pruning:** Uses tree pruning to optimize tree growth.
*   **Handling Missing Values:** Can handle missing values natively.

## Algorithm

1.  Start with an initial prediction (e.g., the mean of the target variable).
2.  Iteratively train new trees:
    *   Calculate the residuals (the difference between the actual values and the current prediction).
    *   Build a new regression tree to predict the residuals.
    *   Add the predictions of the new tree to the current prediction, scaled by a learning rate.
3.  Apply regularization to prevent overfitting.
4.  Use parallel processing to speed up training.
5.  Prune trees to optimize the model.
6.  Handle missing values during training and prediction.

## Advantages

*   High performance and speed.
*   Regularization to prevent overfitting.
*   Handles missing data.
*   Parallel processing.
*   Tree pruning.
*   Built-in cross-validation.

## Disadvantages

*   Can be complex to tune.
*   May require significant memory for large datasets.
*   Sensitive to hyperparameter settings.

## Use Cases

*   Classification problems
*   Regression problems
*   Ranking problems
*   Recommendation systems
