# Decision Tree

## Description
A decision tree is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It splits the data into subsets based on feature values, forming a tree-like structure.

## Key Concepts
- **Root Node**: The starting point of the tree.
- **Leaf Nodes**: Represent the final decision or output.
- **Splitting**: Dividing data based on feature values.
- **Pruning**: Reducing the size of the tree to prevent overfitting.

## Common Applications
- Customer segmentation
- Fraud detection
- Medical diagnosis
- Predictive maintenance

## Advantages
- Easy to understand and interpret.
- Handles both numerical and categorical data.
- Requires little data preprocessing.

## Disadvantages
- Prone to overfitting if not pruned.
- Can be unstable with small changes in data.
- May not perform well with imbalanced datasets.
