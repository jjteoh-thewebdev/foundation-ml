# Random Forest

## Description
Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve classification or regression accuracy. It uses a technique called bagging to create diverse trees.

## Key Concepts
- **Ensemble Learning**: Combining multiple models to improve performance.
- **Bagging**: Sampling data with replacement to train each tree.
- **Feature Importance**: Identifying the most significant features.

## Common Applications
- Fraud detection
- Stock market prediction
- Image classification
- Recommendation systems

## Advantages
- Reduces overfitting compared to a single decision tree.
- Handles large datasets effectively.
- Works well with both classification and regression tasks.

## Disadvantages
- Can be computationally expensive.
- Less interpretable than a single decision tree.
- May require parameter tuning for optimal performance.
