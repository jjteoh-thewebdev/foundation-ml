# Logistic Regression

## Description
Logistic Regression is a statistical model used for binary classification tasks. It predicts the probability of an outcome using a logistic function.

## Key Concepts
- **Sigmoid Function**: Maps predictions to probabilities.
- **Binary Classification**: Predicting one of two possible outcomes.
- **Odds Ratio**: The ratio of the probability of success to failure.

## Common Applications
- Spam email detection
- Credit scoring
- Medical diagnosis
- Customer churn prediction

## Advantages
- Simple and easy to implement.
- Works well with linearly separable data.
- Provides probabilistic outputs.

## Disadvantages
- Assumes linear relationships between features and the target.
- Struggles with non-linear data.
- Sensitive to outliers.
